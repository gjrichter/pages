		<p>The purpose of this map is to illustrate the varying dynamics between world population growth and correlated CO2 emissions over the same time period through a single visualization.</p>

		<p>This geographic representation presents two datasets from distinct sources, superimposing the global population growth and CO2 emissions over the past 60 years.</p>

		<p>The progression of the global population is depicted as a graph across time for each country, with a focus on the most recent 10 years highlighted by different colors.</p>

		<p>CO2 emissions are visualized using circular charts, displaying emission trends over time in a clockwise manner, commencing at 12 oâ€™clock. In this chart, values are aggregated across a grid to prevent overlap.</p>

		<p>Population data is sourced from the World Bank Open Data release, while CO2 emission data is obtained from Our World in Data.</p>
